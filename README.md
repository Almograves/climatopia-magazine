# Climatopia

Climatopia is a speculative design magazine that explores the potential impacts of climate change on human cultures across different habitat scenarios. As our living environments continue to change, we aim to collect and present ideas on how we might adapt to various degrees of speculated environmental change.

## Project Description

As a result of climate change, the living environments of humans across the globe and in the most different circumstances are all changing. This speculative design magazine aims to collect ideas for how the human cultures across different habitat-scenarios might change to adapt to various degrees of speculated environmental change.

## Contents

This magazine covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Atlantis - rising sea levels
- Cactus - growing water scarcity
- Phoenix - increasing temperatures

## Project Lead

This project is currently being developed and maintained by:

- F. St. Marcos
