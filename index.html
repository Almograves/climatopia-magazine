                        For centuries, defensive architecture like dams and other water-blocking technologies have been
                        utilized to safeguard land from the encroaching sea.

                        Certain coastal cities and other cities at risk of flood surges have implemented defenses that
                        are temporarily activated in the case of extreme conditions, such as the Thames Barrier in
                        London or the MOSE in Venice. However, these systems are not equipped to handle the challenges
                        posed by long-term sea level rise (SLR), as are not intended to stay closed for extended periods
                        of time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In some parts of the world, permanent defenses against rising sea levels have been implemented.
                        For instance, the Netherlands, a country much of which lies below sea level, has developed a
                        comprehensive system of dikes, dams, and storm surge barriers, known as the Delta Works, to
                        protect their land.

                    <p>
                        However, these permanent technologies face issues when dealing with SLR on the long term because
                        they require close monitoring, maintinance and upgrades to keep up with erosion and continuing
                        SLR, especially in the face of more frequent and extreme weather events such as storm surges.

                        Many islands are low-lying and vulnerable to even minor increases in sea level. Traditional
                        defensive architecture and beach nourishment (stocking up beaches with sand) are possible to
                        employ, but they can cause significant damage to local ecosystems while still facing the issues
                        described previously. The use of natural defenses like mangroves and coral reefs can help to
                        reduce wave energy and erosion for temporary relief and protection of current ecosystems and
                        human communities.

                        While these concepts offer some protection against SLR, they lack long-term stability and

                        The concept of building floating urban structures on water is not new. In fact, houseboats have been in use for a very long time in many countries around the world. In the face of sea level rise (SLR), floating cities offer a clear advantage: they rise with the sea instead of being inundated.

                        Island nations like the maledives wanting to embrace a floating lifestyle, permanently connected to the sea - as opposed to the high-rise buildings crammed on some of the larger islands - marks a return to a deeply nature-connected culture. While traditional living environments are changing drastically and some of the cultural heritage of many regions of the world will inevitably be lost to the rising sea, living with water might mean forming new, deep connections with the maritime environment. Moreover, living in interconnected networks of small floating buildings could foster stronger communities, resembling villages more than cities.

                        One of the significant challenges for life on Earth under climate change is the slow speed of evolutionary processes. A majority of species will not survive as they can't adapt quickly enough to their changing environments.

                        As sea levels rise, not only are islands that host many unique species threatened, but submarine lifeforms are also at risk. Global warming is causing ocean temperatures to rise, creating conditions that many species cannot tolerate. Additionally, the increasing distance between the ocean floor and surface due to rising sea levels reduces the amount of light available in many areas.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="g4-p-holder" id="atlantis-coral-pHold3">
                    <p>
                        What if we could evolve fast enough to adapt to these changes? If islands become submerged, could human civilizations continue to inhabit the same islands, but below sea level instead of above? Corals would provide a multifunctional, renewable, and climate-positive building material for submarine infrastructure. Humanity could form much stronger bonds with their marine environment than ever before, by learning to coexist, cooperate, and communicate with many other lifeforms.
