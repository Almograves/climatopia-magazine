## Opener:

When coastal cities, islands and entire nations slowly go under in the rising sea, how will human life there continue?

## Sci Back:

Sea-levels are rising as a result of three factors all caused by global warming:
- thermal expansion: seawater expands due to increasing temperatures
- melting glaciers: summer runoff isn't balanced by winter snowfall anymore
- melting ice shields: the ice shields in Greenland and Antarctica are melting

This trend is increasing, with the yearly rise in sea-level accelerating.

This is causing islands across the world to disappear underwater and thousands of coastal cities are threatened of sharing the same fate.

## Defensive architecture

Defensive architecture such as dams and other water-blocking technologies have been employed to protect land from the sea for centuries. Some coastal cities and otherwise flood-surge endangered cities employ  such as in the case of the Thames Barrier protecting London
