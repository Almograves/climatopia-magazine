## Intro:

When coastal cities, islands and entire nations slowly go under in the rising sea, how will human life there change and continue?

Global warming is causing sea levels to rise due to three primary factors:

(SROCC. 2019 IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (eds H-O PÃ¶rtner et al.). In press.)

- Thermal expansion: As the temperature of seawater increases, it expands.
- Melting glaciers: The balance between summer runoff and winter snowfall is being disrupted, as glaciers melt at a faster rate than they are replenished.
- Melting ice shields: The vast ice shields in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, adding large volumes of water to the ocean.

This trend of rising sea levels is not only increasing yearly but accelerating.

The consequences of this trend are severe and far-reaching. Islands across the globe are gradually disappearing underwater. Additionally, thousands of coastal cities face the imminent threat of being submerged. This situation calls for urgent action and adaptation strategies.


## Defensive architecture and preservation strategies

For centuries, defensive architecture like dams and other water-blocking technologies have been utilized to safeguard land from the encroaching sea.

Certain coastal cities and other cities at risk of flood surges have implemented defenses that are temporarily activated in the case of extreme conditions, such as the Thames Barrier in London or the MOSE in Venice. However, these systems are not equipped to handle the challenges posed by long-term sea level rise (SLR), as are not intended to stay closed for extended periods of time.

In some parts of the world, permanent defenses against rising sea levels have been implemented. For instance, the Netherlands, a country much of which lies below sea level, has developed a comprehensive system of dikes, dams, and storm surge barriers, known as the Delta Works, to protect their land. 

However, these permanent technologies face issues when dealing with SLR on the long term because they require close monitoring, maintinance and upgrades to keep up with erosion and continuing SLR, especially in the face of more frequent and extreme weather events such as storm surges.

Many islands are low-lying and vulnerable to even minor increases in sea level. Traditional defensive architecture and beach nourishment (stocking up beaches with sand) are possible to employ, but they can cause significant damage to local ecosystems while still facing the issues described previously. The use of natural defenses like mangroves and coral reefs can help to reduce wave energy and erosion for temporary relief and protection of current ecosystems and human communities.

This system includes the Maeslantkering, a massive movable storm surge barrier designed to withstand a storm that would occur once every 10000 years.

 Despite these impressive defenses, the Netherlands continues to innovate and adapt, exploring new strategies such as 'living with water', which includes the construction of floating houses and infrastructure that can adapt to changing water levels.

For dealing with future increased SLR all those concepts fall short of long-term stability and effectiveness, with the ultimate advice being to move further inland. This however is virtually impossible on islands and other extensive areas that lay barely above the sea level. Those islands and areas will be lost, together with much of their current ecosystems.

While these concepts offer some protection against SLR, they lack long-term stability and effectiveness, as sea levels might rise tremendously over the coming centuries. The prevailing long-term recommendation is to relocate further inland. However, this is not a viable solution for islands and other regions that are barely above sea level. These areas will eventually be completely submerged, leading to the loss of their existing ecosystems and current human living environments.
