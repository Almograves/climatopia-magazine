# Climatopia

##Intro

Climatopia is an ongoing magazine project collecting knowledge and ideas for how adapting to climate change can bring new value to human life. The climatopian future follows 3 core principles:

1. At no point should we stop trying to limit climate change, just because we can imagine dealing well with its effects. Climate change is a near-apocalyptic unpredictable and destructive force that must be stopped.

2. The climatopian future can only strive through the integration of many different sustainable and healing-oriented values. Climatopian ideas and technologies need to be intersectional, equal and available to all.

3. Knowledge is fluid and expandable. Just as the scientific and philosophical consensus evolves over time, climatopian ideas, technologies, writings and even core principles have to evolve to adapt to changing environments. All climatopian work has to stay open to this process.

## How the Climatopia Project Works

Climatopia was initiated by F. St. Marcos in June of 2024 as a plattform for collecting knowledge around effects of climate change and adaptation strategies to it. Intended as a speculative design project, Climatopia originally aims to inspire and ignite discussion rather than comprehensively explaining concrete adaptation technologies. 

With the introduction of the 3 climatopian core principles came the following two conclusions for the magazine project:

- open-source practices: Climatopian technologies have to be accessible to everyone, so the magazine project had to be open-source. This additionally facilitates contributions and ensures transparency.
- fluidity of content: Climatopian work has to keep evolving, so the magazine project by definition never takes a final form. Articles might be incomplete or change over time, which in turn shapes the design and feeling of the magazine.

All the materials used and text and code written for Climatopia can be found on https://github.com/Almograves/climatopia-magazine 

The magazine is made using Paged.js. You can print your own copy without having to locally open the html file by finding a pdf version you like on the GitHub page.
