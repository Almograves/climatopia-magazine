##Intro

Climatopia is an ongoing magazine project collecting knowledge and ideas for how adapting to climate change can bring new value to human life. The climatopian future follows 3 core principles:

1. At no point should we stop trying to limit climate change, just because we can imagine dealing well with its effects. Climate change is a near-apocalyptic unpredictable and destructive force that must be stopped.

2. The climatopian future can only strive through the integration of many different sustainable and healing-oriented values. Climatopian ideas and technologies need to be intersectional, equal and available to all.

3. Knowledge is fluid and expandable. Just as the scientific and philosophical consensus evolves over time, climatopian ideas, technologies, writings and even core principles have to evolve to adapt to changing environments. All climatopian work has to stay open to this process.
