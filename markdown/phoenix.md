## Intro:

When cities, seas and air slowly heat up to unpreceded levels in most areas, how will human life there change and continue?

With global warming, further heat related events become more extreme and frequent:

(Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate. 2021. Climate Change: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (eds Seneviratne, S.I. et al.))

- Hot extremes: The frequency and intensity of hot extremes (including heatwaves) is increasing
- Fire Weather: The probability of compound events such as fire weather conditions (hot, dry and windy - conductive to wildfires) is increasing
- Heavy precipitation: The frequency of heavy precipitation is increasing over a majority of land regions

This trend of weather and climate extremes events of all types is accelerating.

The consequences of this trend are severe and far-reaching. All regions across the globe are experiencing unprecedently hot weather, posing serious threats to human health and ecosystems and disrupting societies and economies. This situation calls for urgent action and adaptation strategies.
