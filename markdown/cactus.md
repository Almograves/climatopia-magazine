## Intro:

When potable water slowly becomes a rare resource in many regions, how will human life there change and continue?

Due to climate change the availability of potable water is increasingly threatened in many regions by various factors:

(Water. 2022. Climate Change: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. Contribution of Working Group II to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (eds Caretta, M.A. et al.))

- Droughts: The frequency and intensity of dry periods and droughts are increasing globally
- Floods and water-caused damages: Increasingly frequent floods cause damage to infrastructures and ecosystems, consequentially affecting water safety
- Glaciers and snowmelt: The accelerated melting of glaciers and decreased snowfall are threatening water security in regions that depend on meltwater.

This trend of extreme water-endangering conditions is accelerating.

The consequences of this trend are severe and far-reaching. Not only are already disatvantaged groups and populations especially affected by these developments, but no demographic or geographic group including the richest and most developed regions are spared from the threat of water scarcity. This situation calls for urgent action and adaptation strategies.
